An artificial neural network based number recognizer, that takes data in from a HTML canvas and preprocesses it before feeding it into a neural network trained on the MNIST data set.

NOTE: The backend for the demo is hosted on Render with a free plan and therefore it takes around 1 minute for the first request to be processed. This happens since the server goes to sleep in periods of inactivity, the next requests after the first one will be processed almost instantly. So if you want to try the demo, you will need to wait around 1 minute for the first request to be processed.
